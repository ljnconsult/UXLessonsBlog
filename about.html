<div class="editable"><h1>About</h1><p>I'm John and I started this blog to help people learn about the field of User Experience. It does not matter if you are interested in research, design or strategy. Whether you are new to UX or you've been working the field for a few years. My goal is to provide information to help you learn the skills you need to be successful and advance your career.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
