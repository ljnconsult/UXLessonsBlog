If you are new to UX you are probably wondering which design tools you should learn to secure a job. If you’ve been a UX designer for a while, you’ve probably settled on two or three design tools as your favorites but you may be looking for some other tools to streamline your workflow or increase your marketability as a UX designer. This article will cover several tools listed on [uxtools.co](http://uxtools.co/tools/design) and I’ll share my personal opinion based on 20 years of experience working with various design tools.

**The Adobe Tools**

Good old Photoshop and Illustrator, and Adobe’s newcomer XD. I lumped these three tools together because they are part of one suite that you can purchase from Adobe as a subscription called the Creative Cloud. Nearly every designer has heard of Photoshop and Illustrator at some point because Adobe tools have been around for many years. Photoshop is the most widely used professional photo manipulation software in the world and Illustrator is the most versatile vector-based tool on the market.

Adobe XD is slightly different though, it was created from the ground up by Adobe as a rapid design/prototyping tool for UX designers. The biggest benefits of using XD are the ability to do design and prototyping all in one tool and its integration with other Adobe tools. For example, if you already use Photoshop and Illustrator in your design workflow, then it may make sense for you to use XD as your prototyping tool.

UXers should definitely familiarize themselves with Photoshop and Illustrator. I still see many companies listing proficiency with Adobe tools as a preferred skill. Photoshop and Illustrator are the tools I first learned in my early years as a web designer and even though I don’t use them as often, I still recommend learning them. I taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator many years ago and it is even easier to learn these tools today with online tutorials such as the ones offered by Lynda.com.

**The Current Favorite - Sketch**

Sketch is a Mac only design tool that has become the favorite of many UX designers. Sketch allows you to create vector-based designs and it leverages art boards, symbols and libraries to help you stay organized and make changes rapidly. The ability to extend Sketch with hundreds of plugins makes it even more powerful. For example, with plugins, you can enhance your designs, automate tasks, import data, and export/convert your designs. Sketch also comes with a free cloud account where you can upload your designs and share them to gather user and team feedback.

I’m not a Sketch expert by any means, but I’ve begun to favor it over Photoshop, Illustrator and XD and Axure for building out simple website and app designs. I’ve also seen many job postings that list Sketch as a preferred tool so definitely add Sketch to your list of tools to consider for UX design.

**Tools to Watch in 2018**

Framer is primarily a prototyping tool and designers need to be comfortable writing code in order to truly take advantage of Framer. The good news is that Framer recently enhanced its built-in design tools and that has made Framer’s design/prototyping workflow a little easier. So if you are comfortable coding and you need to create high quality prototypes, then take a look at Framer.

Sketch might be the current favorite of UX designers but InVision Studio might be the tool to supplant Sketch in the near future. Studio is in early access rollout as of this writing but there is a lot of buzz around this tool as it promises to seamlessly combine powerful design, prototyping and collaboration in one cross-platform (Mac and Windows) tool.

Last but certainly not least, the browser-based design tools such as Figma and UXPin are growing in popularity; they offer good design tools, plus collaborative design environments, shared libraries and components.

**Tools Are Great But…**

Learning the latest tools may help you gain an edge in your job search and the right tools can also save time and improve collaboration within your team. &nbsp;But keep in mind that simply learning tools won’t make you a great UX designer no more than swinging a shiny new hammer onto a nail will make you a great carpenter. Tools will never replace a solid user-centered design process and UX design tools change constantly so use whatever tool(s) you and your team are most comfortable with to get the job done.
