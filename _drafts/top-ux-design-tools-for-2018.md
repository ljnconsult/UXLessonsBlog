**Why UX Design Tools Matter**

If you are new to UX you are probably wondering which design tools should I learn to advance my skills and secure a job? If you’ve been a UX designer for a while, you’ve probably settled on two or three design tools as your favorites but you may be wondering which tools are popular within the industry these days. This article will cover several of the top tools listed on uxtools.co ([http://uxtools.co/tools/design)](http://uxtools.co/tools/design)) and I’ll also share my personal opinion based on 17 years of experience with design tools.

**The Classic UX Design Tools**

Good old Photoshop and Illustrator, and Adobe’s newcomer XD. I lumped these three tools together because they are part of one suite that you can purchase from Adobe as a subscription called the Creative Cloud.

Just about every designer has heard of Photoshop and Illustrator at some point because those tools have been around for many years. Photoshop is the most widely used professional photo manipulation software in the world and Illustrator is the most versatile vector-based tool on the market.

Adobe XD is slightly different though, it was created from the ground up by Adobe as a rapid design/prototyping tool for UX designers. The biggest benefits of using XD are the ability to do design and prototyping all in one tool and its integration with other Adobe tools. If you already use Photoshop and Illustrator in your design workflow, then it may make sense for you to use XD as your prototyping tool.

UXers should definitely familiarize themselves with Photoshop and Illustrator. I still see many companies listing proficiency with Adobe tools as preferred skills. Photoshop and Illustrator are the tools I first learned in my early years as a web designer and I still use Photoshop and Illustrator in my UX work today. By the way, I taught myself Photoshop and Illustrator from books many years ago and you can to. If you don’t want to learn from books check out Lynda.com and similar website for tutorials.

**A Popular UX Design Tool**

Sketch is a Mac only design tool that has become the current favorite of many UX designers. Sketch allows you to create vector-based designs and it leverages art boards, symbols and libraries to help you stay organized and make changes rapidly. The ability to extend Sketch with hundreds of plugins makes it even more powerful; with plugins, you can enhance your designs, automate tasks, import data, and export/convert your designs. Sketch also comes with a free cloud account where you can upload your designs and share them to gather user and team feedback.

I’m not a Sketch expert by any means, but I’ve begun to favor it over Photoshop, Illustrator and XD and Axure (one of the earliest UX design tools) for building out simple website and app designs. I’ve also seen many job postings that list Sketch as a preferred tool so definitely add Sketch to your list of tools to consider for UX design.

**Tools to Watch in 2018**

Online design and collaboration tools such as UXPin and Figma are growing in popular. These tools may not

**Framer and Invision Studio**

Before concluding this article, I want to add that simply learning the latest tools won’t make you a great UX designer no more than swinging a shiny new hammer onto a nail will make you a great carpenter. UX tools change constantly so use whatever tool(s) you are comfortable with to get the job done. However, experience with the latest tools may give you a slight edge in your job search and the right tools can also save time and improve collaboration within your team.
