What is UX? You may get a different answer to that question depending on who you ask. Over the years, I have given that question and answer a lot of thought but my research kept pointing me back to the same source and definition.

That source is Donald Norman; he was the first person at Apple Computer to have “User Experience” in his job title back in 1993. He is also the author of the popular book The Design of Everyday Things, and if you have not read his book yet I highly recommend it for all current and future UXers.

Donald Norman describes UX as, “everything that touches upon your experience with the product”. His definition has been further refined by a group he co-founded, the Nielsen Norman Group. The Nielsen Norman Group believes, “user experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products”.

Now even though design methods and technology have advanced over the years, Norman’s definition of UX is still compelling. That’s because UX is fundamentally not about a particular design method, device or technology such as websites or apps. It’s not the same thing as the UI (user interface), nor is UX simply part of someone’s job title, such as “UX Designer”.

So when people ask me how I define UX, I respond with a similar definition to Norman but I also factor in the affective aspects of human-computer interaction such as the users feelings and emotions.Therefore, I often respond;

***"A user experience is an end-user’s feelings and beliefs about a company, its services and products based on one or more interactions.”***

With this definition I am attempting to go a little deeper than Norman’s original definition and demonstrate that a user experience ultimately results in positive or negative emotions from the end user. Thus, UX is not merely about making usable products and services but also makings products and services more enjoyable to use.

How about you? How do you respond to the question, what is UX? Who or what helped you arrive at your definition? Go ahead and comment below.
