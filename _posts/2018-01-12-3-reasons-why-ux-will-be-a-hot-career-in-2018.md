These are exciting times to be involved in the field of User Experience or UX as we call it.  Websites and mobile apps were just the tip of the iceberg in terms of digital products and services that needed the attention of UX professionals. In 2018, I believe we will see an explosion of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) products, voice enabled and artificial intelligence (AI) products, smart devices and wearables. And let’s not forget cars that drive themselves such as the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot).

At its core, UX is about building better products and services by following a user-centered design process. However, the term UX is a broad one because there are many factors that impact “the experience” of a product or service, such as the user interface (UI), visual design, content, usability, accessibility, find-ability, etc. Therefore, it takes many different skill sets to optimize the UX of any product or service.

This brings us to the first of 3 reasons why UX is such a hot career right now.

### **New Technology = New Experiences**

With all these VR/AR, voice enabled, smart and connected wearable devices hitting the market, more UXers will be employed to research, design and strategize how to improve these technologies, so they can 1) delight customers with amazing experiences and 2) increase product market share. A good example of a rapidly growing technology is Amazon’s Echo product which leverages voice and AI to create a new way to interact with Amazon.com, your music and other devices and services with simple voice commands. Google has taken note of the AI/voice enabled device trend and released a similar product last October called the Google Home Mini. Apple is also expected to release their Siri based HomePod device in early 2018. This is great news for UXers interested in leveraging voice and AI technology to create better experiences. And I’ve recently seen several jobs posting for companies looking for UXers with experience in voice and AI technology. Also, keep your eye on advances in VR, I was finally convinced about the merits of this technology after I experienced PlayStation VR last Christmas. VR is so immersive and it opens up a whole new world of interaction between the real world and virtual spaces.

### **UXers Make More Money?**

I posed the headline as a question because there are several factors that impact salaries such as job title, location, years of experience, etc. However, all things being equal, we consistently see higher salaries with User Experience Designers versus Graphic and Visual Designers. Here are the numbers from payscale.com as you can see the difference in the average salary is XXXXX. Also, UX Researchers also make a substantial income compared to other research careers.

### **UX Is Fun and Rewarding**

People come to UX from many different backgrounds; I’ve met anthropologists, psychologists, programmers, writers, engineers, graphic designers, project managers, entrepreneurs, musicians and teachers that have made the switch to UX and they’ve become fairly successful. The best part is that most UXers don’t measure their success in terms of their salary. Instead they talk about how much fun they are having designing and prototyping a new website or mobile app or game or physical product. They also love researching, gathering data and conducting user interviews. They are also writing content, planning and strategizing with cross-functional teams. If this type of work excites you then UX is definitely a field to consider.

I hope you’ve found this article helpful, I actually started out in marketing and web design back in 2000 and I transitioned to UX after completing my master’s degree in human-computer interaction in 2013. I really enjoy this field and I’ve made it my mission to help others succeed in their UX career.
