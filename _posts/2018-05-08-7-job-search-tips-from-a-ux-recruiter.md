UX Recruiters match User Experience talent with employers seeking to fill related roles. They are compensated by employers if their candidate is hired, so there are no upfront costs to work with them.

A seasoned UX Recruiter has established a network of companies actively seeking out UX talent. They may be able to get your resume in front of hiring managers quickly, provide resume/portfolio feedback, and share valuable insights about potential employers and job opportunities.

I reached out to Laura Hunter of Vivid Resources to learn more about working with UX Recruiters. Vivid Resources is a staffing firm dedicated to helping companies large and small find the best UX professionals available. Laura has worked in UX for over 14 years and tech in general since 1996.

Here are Laura’s top tips for working with UX Recruiters and improving your job search:

1. Be organized in your job search; create a simple spreadsheet to track your applications.

2. Update your resume so that it speaks directly to the opportunity you are applying for.

3. Avoid resumes over one page in length unless you have more than ten years of experience.

4. Keep your picture off of your resume, your LinkedIn picture is enough. The client wants to know about your skills and can easily access your appearance in LinkedIn prior to the interview if desired.

5. In interviews, be prepared to tell your story; walk interviewers through your projects and share your journey/process.

6. Don’t allow recruiters to send out your resume or portfolio without your knowledge and permission.

7. If a UX Recruiter is already representing you to an employer, don’t submit your resume directly to the employer again.<br><br>I want to thank Laura for taking time to share her insights on this topic.
